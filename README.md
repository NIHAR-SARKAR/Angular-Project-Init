# Angular-Project-Init

Setup for local development
The QuickStart live-coding / download example example is an Angular playground. It's not where you'd develop a real application. You should develop locally on your own machine ... and that's also how we think you should learn Angular.

Setting up a new project on your machine is quick and easy with the QuickStart seed, maintained on github.

Make sure you have Node.jsÂ® and npm installed.

Clone
Perform the clone-to-launch steps with these terminal commands.

git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart.git quickstart
cd quickstart
npm install
npm start
npm start fails in Bash for Windows in versions earlier than the Creator's Update (April 2017).

Download
Download the QuickStart seed and unzip it into your project folder. Then perform the remaining steps with these terminal commands.
